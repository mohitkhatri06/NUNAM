Assessment task for Backend Data Engineer Internship.
Only first 2 questions had been done I fail to do the `low pass filter` technique for noise removal.

##### In first question all the files had been extracted from the xlsx file
##### In second question I had applied the down-sampling method to reduce the sampling rate  to `1 sample/minute` and took the average of the other values.
